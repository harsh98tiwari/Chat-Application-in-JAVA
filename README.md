# Chat-Application-in-JAVA
This is a Java-based chat application that allows real-time communication between a user and a server. 
The application is built using multi-threading and socket programming concepts, providing an efficient and responsive chat experience.
The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Java Swing, offering a user-friendly way to interact with the chat functionality.

#Features
Real-Time Chat: Users can exchange messages with the server in real-time, making the application suitable for instant communication.

Multi-Threading: The application employs multi-threading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
This ensures that the server can serve multiple users without blocking any one user's interaction.

User-Friendly GUI: The Java Swing GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to send and receive messages. 
The interface is designed to be simple yet effective, making the chat experience seamless.

Customizable: The application's architecture allows for easy customization and extension. 
You can enhance the features or modify the design according to your requirements.
